Subject: Unable to Attend Meeting

Hi Bob,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to inform you that I will not be able to attend the meeting scheduled for 10 AM due to traveling.

I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and hope we can reschedule for a more convenient time. Please let me know a new date and time that works for you.

Thank you for your understanding.

Best regards,

Sam
